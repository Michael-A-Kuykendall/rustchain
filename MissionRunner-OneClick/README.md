## 💡 The Key Insight

**Small AI = Better Results for Code Tasks**

Large language models try to be helpful by:
- Adding extra features you didn't ask for
- Explaining everything in detail
- Second-guessing your requirements
- Creating overcomplicated solutions

TinyLlama just:
- Follows your exact instructions
- Generates clean, simple code
- Doesn't overthink the task
- Produces predictable results
